# Research and Comprehend

## Introduction to Computer Vision
- Start by researching the basic concepts of Computer Vision, focusing on how AI systems process visual information.
  Computer vision, a field of AI, enables machines to interpret visual data by analyzing images or videos to recognize patterns and objects for applications like object detection and image segmentation (Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications, Szeliski, 2022).

One of the basic concepts of Computer Vision is Image Processing. Image processing prepares visual data, while computer vision interprets it to understand scenes and objects, key for applications like face recognition  (Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications, Szeliski, 2022).

Another example is Feature extraction that identifies distinctive parts of an image, like edges or textures, helping machines recognize similar patterns in different images (Object Recognition from Local Scale-Invariant Features, Lowe, 1999).


- Understand the role of image processing in AI, including why AI systems must enhance, manipulate, and analyze images effectively.

## Overview of Image Processing Techniques
- Explore the key techniques used in image processing, such as filtering, edge detection, and segmentation.
- Identify at least three core techniques and investigate how these techniques help AI systems to extract meaningful information from images.
